            <p class="text-white-2"> Chris Bumstead is an IFBB pro bodybuilder from Canada, born on February 2, 1995 (age 27 years old), who is a reigning, defending, undisputed Mr. Olympia Classic Physique winner.

                Not only is Chris a pro bodybuilder, but he is also a fitness model such as Andrei Deiu , a sponsored athlete, an online trainer, and a social media influencer thanks to his impressive physique and his accomplishments.
                
                Chris stands at 6ft 1 inch tall and weighs in at between 235 lbs when competing, and 260lbs during the off-season when he is bulking and can be more relaxed with his diet and with his workout.
                
                Bumstead has one of the most impressive physiques in the industry as he is carrying a lot of mass and size, without any bloating while maintaining a small waist and a very impressive V taper.
                
                His physique reminds a lot of people of a cross between a prime Arnold Schwarzenegger and Frank Zane..
