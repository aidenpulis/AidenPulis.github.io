                    In a seven-year-old division, Bumstead is officially the majority stakeholder for Classic Physique Olympia wins. This marks CBum’s fourth-straight victory dating back to 2019. Prior to the Canadian, there were only two other division winners — Danny Hester in 2016 and then Breon Ansley in 2017-2018. 

Bumstead’s pro career kicked off in 2016 and it’s been essentially nothing but podium for the now-27-year-old. In 2016, he placed first at the IFBB North American Championships as a Men’s Heavyweight bodybuilder. He transitioned to Classic Physique for his next pro show and placed third. 

In 2017, he swept up at the Toronto Pro and Pittsburgh Pro, eventually earning second at that year’s Olympia. He’d take second to Breon once more at the 2018 Olympia (his only contest that year), and then began his reign as king of Classic Physique.

With 12.5 million Instagram follower and 2.6 million YouTube subscribers, Bumstead remains the most popular personality in physique sports, generating traffic (and sometimes memes) in the health and fitness space.
